      "  My first working day on my current job was super cool. At my first day, I was very nervous because I didn’t know anybody, just my CEO and manager. My onboarding started with an “Academy for newcomer” and “Academy of inspiration”. Here came “WoW”. I found all the answers to the questions I wanted to ask. Everything was structured and clear. I learned about the values of my company, approaches to work, people(my colleagues). I realized that I am not just another new employee. I am a part of a huge team, and we have a common goal. I suppose every new employee wants to feel cared about. Each new lesson inspired me more and more. I found a lot of useful information which I use now. The coolest feature of academies is that you can get back to it whenever you want. In case you forget something or want to read again.These two academies were filled with videos, animations, gif, and other interactive stuff. I was completely caught up in the academy that I did not notice how the first working day flew by. After two days of studying academies, I got the test. I checked my knowledge of the rules, structure, mission of the company, and received a certificate. I was proud of myself and felt that I am a full member of the team. That was my best experience in employee onboarding. I hope more and more companies will build their onboarding process in such a way!  May success attend you."

      "Confusing, frustrating, and sometimes boring. Let me backtrack a bit here.The first job that I got that wasn’t mowing lawn for my Dad was at a family friend’s coffee shop. Sometimes, when we go up to our cabin, we pop in there. Just to say hi, and maybe get something to eat/drink. The owner has always joked that someday I will be working at her shop. We were even talking about me possibly working at her shop next summer. Then, one day towards to end of summer we went in. It was swamped in there. I mean line out the door, dishes piled to the ceiling, and two people working. The owner and her son were freaking out.  I saw my opportunity. My Mom and I decided to wait for things to cool down in there, and come back again to see if I could work for a few hours. “Elizabeth? Why aren’t you washing the mugs? And you need to finish buttering the bread for those sandwiches.”  The doorbell jingled again and my boss ran off to help the customer. Dishes piled up all around the three industrial sinks stared at me. The blender started to whir again, signaling something else that would need to be washed. My whole soul wanted to quit. What had I gotten myself into? I could be swimming and tanning right now, and instead I’m in a cramped kitchen scrubbing dishes. After about an hour of furiously scrubbing and cursing under my breath, the shop began to slow down. Finally, my boss closed for her lunch break. Her “lunch break” that she was using to train me. ”Put a few of these droplets into that sink. That makes those things sterile. Let them soak in there for thirty seconds.” She patiently explained everything. When I turned the water too cold for washing dishes, she turned it back to a hot enough temperature. When I didn’t leave a bin for customers to put dirty dishes in, she explained while blending a new smoothie. When I was taking too long to butter sandwiches, she showed me the right way. The first two hours of my first job were hell. I had no idea what I was doing, I was in way over my head, and I would rather be anywhere else. The last two hours, however, were full of patient teaching. Full of both independence and dependence. I finally broke through my shell there, and finally got comfortable with my first job."

      "    After completing studies, we all are desperate to get a job. But, after getting job, we all have an unknown fear about the workplace. When I got my joining date, I was very happy. :smile:But as the date came nearer, I was a bit nervous. Many questions occupied my brain like how will be the atmosphere of the office, will I be able to adjust with the colleagues, will I be able to work well and completer targets, etc.:oh: When I joined the office, on the first day at office, I was little tensed till got acquainted with the workplace and co-workers. But once as days passed, I became comfortable with all. And today love my work and workplace.:peace:"

      "    The beginning is a place where we all have to start at some point in our lives. It could be the beginning of a marriage, a relationship, a business, a pregnancy, or a job. The one thing all these relationships would have in common is that you don’t know what it’s going to be like. We all have our expectations; in courtship, before marriage, research and planning, before starting a business, and the interview before starting the job. Not even the interview and the expectations of my job role, would have prepared me for the strange task I was faced with on my first day on a new job.I had just completed my eight week training as a Cisco Certified Network Administrator, (C C N A), and had been wondering how I would show more content.Sarah greeted me at the front desk then showed me to my cubicle. It was a pretty little corner with every tool you could imagine to fix a computer; the only thing that was missing was my computer. When I enquired about that, Sarah beamed at me and said “well that is your first task, to build your own computer, then start using it.” I gulped, before asking where the computer was. She pointed to it in a little corner and left me on my own to start work.I rushed to look at the computer; I couldn’t even locate the nails I needed to open it. In school I had learnt on a really old model and it seems the newer models no longer used nails. I broke out in cold sweat, my first instinct was to call my cousin in Detroit who’s also a hardware technician. “Junior, I need your help, I have to build a computer and it’s one of the newer models. I can’t find the screws to even open it.” Junior was kind enough to google the computer model for me and guide me through the process of opening the computer. To this day I can still hear Junior saying, “the model has buttons to push down on, just hold the buttons down hard enough and the computer will spring open.” After that it was smooth sailing for me and I completed the build within two hours. From that first day google became my best friend and helped me to become a very successful hardware developer."

      " My first day on this job was interesting.  It was my birthday, which is interesting because the company has a policy of giving you a day off for your birthday.  I met my boss at the airport and we flew up to the San Francisco bay area.  We were merging two companies, and I was flying up North for six weeks to learn from the people who chose not to relocate. I learned a lot, but we had a lot of fun.  The company was paying the people who stayed to the end a bonus to ease the transition, (though we still lost a couple along the way as they got job offers).  Most people had a bit of short-timer's syndrome and weren't working that hard.  Somebody brought a barbecue and they bought stuff to grill for lunch each day. On top of this I was learning about products, technologies and applications that I wasn't familiar with.  Fortunately, they had a couple of really smart people that helped me a lot."

      "  It was… quiet. It was a day filled with installing programs, large ones at that, and waiting for them to finish doing their thing. This was book-ended by Windows updating itself, so more hanging around waiting. Eventually, I took off at around 3pm. One of the easiest first days I’ve had. After that, I was ready to get stuck in, but the first day was making me restless, as I was itching to get going and put the career change into gear."

      "    I am basically still working in my first-job, but in a new department now. I will write about my experience in my first department.After completing my studies, I had a hard time finding a job. I didn't want to sit around at home, so I took a position with a Temp-Company. They were able to find me a job quickly in a prestigious bank. I worked as an Assistant to the CEO.I came in at about 10am on the first day (was at the Temp-Company before, getting all my papers signed) and my boss welcomed me with open arms. He shook my hand, introduced me to my colleague and the other CEO. He showed me where my desk was and told me that my colleague would help me get started. She was very helpful and I sat next to her for the morning and just watched what she did.At lunch my boss and the other CEO invited me to lunch. I was so nervous, I could hardly eat a thing! We were gone for about 1-1.5 hours and just talked about the company, my studies, etc. After lunch my boss took me on the tour of our floor. Introduced me to everyone, showed me where the kitchen was, how the coffee machine worked, where the copy machine was, all that good stuff.My college left at 3pm, so I had some time to myself to figure out the new computer system and just look around. My day ended at 5.30pm."

//The first day is always the toughest

// I can’t lie, it was nerve wracking. It was 1988, I was dispatched from my electrical apprenticeship hall to a high rise in Boston, during the middle of winter. I was used to the cold, but I wasn’t used to the extreme hazards of a construction site, and one of this magnitude. I constantly had to be aware of my surroundings, for one false move could be fatal. The faces on the jobsite that had time under their belt, seemed hardened. It was hard to believe they were children once giggling. I learned later that the job consisted of veterans of World War 2, The Korean War, and the Vietnam War. So not only did the element of a construction site show on their faces, but most likely the horrors of war. They were a bit intimidating, and didn’t speak to me aside from giving orders. I was handed a radio and just basically ran supplies up and down the stairwells to the various floors, and to the journeyman electricians. 
// I was called “Kid”. That didn’t bother. That’s the name for the new arrivals to a site. I finished the day without injury, and was truly grateful. The exposure to the wind blowing off the Atlantic Ocean, the constant moving, and the mental stress of a first big construction site and the hazards involved, had me so wiped out shortly after I arrived home and showered, I just crashed on my bed.
//     Well here I am almost 32 years later, still in the construction industry, having worked in many cities in the USA, Iraq, Dubai, and Afghanistan.
// All sorts of memories. But I can never forget my first day as a “Kid” on a construction site. I can smile at that thought. The first day is always the toughest and I made it!
