    "The beginning is a place where we all have to start at some point in our lives. It could be the beginning of a marriage, a relationship, a business, a pregnancy, or a job. The one thing all these relationships would have in common is that you don’t know what it’s going to be like. We all have our expectations; in courtship, before marriage, research and planning, before starting a business, and the interview before starting the job. Not even the interview and the expectations of my job role, would have prepared me for the strange task I was faced with on my first day on a new job.I had just completed my eight week training as a Cisco Certified Network Administrator, (C C N A), and had been wondering how I would show more content.Sarah greeted me at the front desk then showed me to my cubicle. It was a pretty little corner with every tool you could imagine to fix a computer; the only thing that was missing was my computer. When I enquired about that, Sarah beamed at me and said “well that is your first task, to build your own computer, then start using it.” I gulped, before asking where the computer was. She pointed to it in a little corner and left me on my own to start work.I rushed to look at the computer; I couldn’t even locate the nails I needed to open it. In school I had learnt on a really old model and it seems the newer models no longer used nails. I broke out in cold sweat, my first instinct was to call my cousin in Detroit who’s also a hardware technician. “Junior, I need your help, I have to build a computer and it’s one of the newer models. I can’t find the screws to even open it.” Junior was kind enough to google the computer model for me and guide me through the process of opening the computer. To this day I can still hear Junior saying, “the model has buttons to push down on, just hold the buttons down hard enough and the computer will spring open.” After that it was smooth sailing for me and I completed the build within two hours. From that first day google became my best friend and helped me to become a very successful hardware developer."

    "I am basically still working in my first-job, but in a new department now. I will write about my experience in my first department.After completing my studies, I had a hard time finding a job. I didn't want to sit around at home, so I took a position with a Temp-Company. They were able to find me a job quickly in a prestigious bank. I worked as an Assistant to the CEO.I came in at about 10am on the first day (was at the Temp-Company before, getting all my papers signed) and my boss welcomed me with open arms. He shook my hand, introduced me to my colleague and the other CEO. He showed me where my desk was and told me that my colleague would help me get started. She was very helpful and I sat next to her for the morning and just watched what she did.At lunch my boss and the other CEO invited me to lunch. I was so nervous, I could hardly eat a thing! We were gone for about 1-1.5 hours and just talked about the company, my studies, etc. After lunch my boss took me on the tour of our floor. Introduced me to everyone, showed me where the kitchen was, how the coffee machine worked, where the copy machine was, all that good stuff.My college left at 3pm, so I had some time to myself to figure out the new computer system and just look around. My day ended at 5.30pm."

       "After completing studies, we all are desperate to get a job. But, after getting job, we all have an unknown fear about the workplace. When I got my joining date, I was very happy. :smile:But as the date came nearer, I was a bit nervous. Many questions occupied my brain like how will be the atmosphere of the office, will I be able to adjust with the colleagues, will I be able to work well and completer targets, etc.:oh: When I joined the office, on the first day at office, I was little tensed till got acquainted with the workplace and co-workers. But once as days passed, I became comfortable with all. And today love my work and workplace.:peace:"
